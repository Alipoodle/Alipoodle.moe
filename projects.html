        <h3 href="">ShadeBot</h3>
        <p>ShadeBot is one of my most notable projects for me, and was the start of me really learning to JavaScript/NodeJS! ShadeBot is a Management Bot for <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> (A gaming chat client), that allows user to setup a passworded server. This requires a user to create a "Limbo" channel where users are unable to chat in the normal chats, giving them a chance to read the rules and agree to them with a password. The Bot comes with a few other moderation features including Muting users, Information about server, role, user ETC and some fun commands.</p>

        <h3>RoleRoomBot</h3>
        <p>RoleRoomBot is another Discord Bot, but it's purpose it to provide users with roles that they request for. This was originally a feature within ShadeBot, however wanting to make it public, I needed to change how it worked. The whole point of this bot is to have a room that users are able to ask for roles and it will be provided to them!</p>
        
        <h3>osu!Info</h3>
        <p>Feat. GreenTurtwig</p>
        <p>This was a project I had started off with one of my School friends. This was a project to make a way of viewing information about your profile for the rhythm game <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/home">osu!</a> The project was one of the first main projects I had started out on and I was able to create a function for working out how to place the A,S,SS amount in the center correctly, and a mod check which was used on the website however that has since been removed. I helped for a few other features but weren't notable.</p>

        <h3>Circle-People.com</h3>
        <p>Circle people are a YouTube group dedicated for posting top plays for osu! and they had opened up the offer for people to help them develop their website. I was quick to jump into it, and became one of the lead developers and had started creating a <a href="./circlepeople">quick template</a> of an Idea as to what the website could look like. A similar style was overall used for it. I've been one of the main developers for their front end stuff however the project and since come to a halt, as a full rework of the website is complete.</p>

        <h3>GPMDP Midnight Accent</h3>
        <p>Google Play Music Desktop Player Midnight Accent... is a project I made for themeing the unoffical Google Play Music Desktop player with a similar style to Play Midnight a chrome Extension that themes the website in a Dark theme with a choice of Custom Accent color! I decided to make a similar style to work with the existing Dark theme within the Google Play Music Desktop player!</p>

        <h3>BTEC Project Archive</h3>
        <p>This is a collection of some of the old projects that I had developed during my time at school. None of these projects are really meant to be amazing complex programs, it was more a way of showing that I was able to completing a task.</p>
