      <h1 align="center" class="about-me">About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm a very Mysterious person, I don't like to show my face or my name to the world. On the internet, I prefer to go by the Alias: Alipoodle. I know Visual Basic and C# well, mainly as these are both .net languages. I was taught VB in Year 10 and 11 in my Secondary School and then went on to self-learn C# because of the similarities between the 2 languages as well as C# being more widely used within programs nowadays. 
        <br>I also have good knowledge within CSS, HTML and JS, however these are more for the tweaking of things. If there's a website, and there's something wrong with how it looks, I will generally change it to look to what I feel is nicer. One of the great examples of this is the BetterDiscord Dark Matter theme I've updated. Discord made a big change on the Settings page and I've continued to keep it this theme updated to how I feel the developer of it would have wanted it to!</p>
        
      <h2 align="center" class="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
        <p><b><i class="mdi mdi-gamepad-variant"></i> Gaming</b>, I’ve always enjoy the playing of games, it’s something satisficing of playing as another character and getting to do things that you would never have could do!
        <br><b><i class="mdi mdi-google-play"></i> Music</b>, I enjoy music a so much that I started learning the drums in around 2010, and in more recent years have started to do a bit of recording of Covers to songs on my Drum kit.
        <br><b><i class="mdi mdi-pencil"></i> DIY</b>, I've always loved a little bit of DIY. It’s more been the idea of getting to make something with the small bits and bobs you have, to create something helpful or cool!
          
      <h1 align="center" class="project">Projects</h1>
      <p><i class="mdi mdi-chevron-right"></i><b><a class="projects" href="https://alipoodle.me/"><i class="mdi mdi-web"></i> Alipoodle.me</a></b><br> Well you’re looking at it. This is Alipoodle.me, and a lot of it has been made by me. <i>Note the github page is private cause it's messy and you shouldn't be trying to steal my website :)</i>
        <br><br><i class="mdi mdi-chevron-right"></i><a class="projects" href="https://github.com/Alipoodle/ShadeBot-Discord"><i class="mdi mdi-discord"></i><b> ShadeBot Bot for Discord</b></a><br> This is a bot for Discord made in JavaScript, that will allow you to have a room where a user should agree to the rules of a server by sending a specific word / phase. Then the bot will check if the user has a profile picture or not. If they do, then they are given a role and welcome them in a chosen room. If not, they will be send a private message. This bot has been made very simple by using a large number of variables making it easy for someone to change this up for any server! 
        <br><br><i class="mdi mdi-chevron-right"></i><a class="projects" href="https://github.com/GreenTurtwig/osu-info"><i class="mdi mdi-music-circle"></i><b> osu! Info</b></a><br> This is a program for Windows that shows you information about your osu account in a nice clean Material design. This shows some of your general information about your account such as the number of As, Ss, SSs Ranks you have and PP, Top 5 plays and Recent Plays both. The program is very customizable and allows for Dark / Light themes and a choice of Accent colour (<i>Made with <a href="https://github.com/GreenTurtwig" class="other-people"><i class="mdi mdi-account"></i>GreenTurtwig </a></i>).

There's various variables used in it for easy change of look.

I'm always keeping this up-to date and adding other small little features like inverting the default album art colour. This theme is based off <a href="https://github.com/chrisxclash/play-midnight/"><i class="mdi mdi-github-circle"></i>Play Midnight</a> an extension for Chrome!
        <br><br><i class="mdi mdi-chevron-right"></i><a class="projects" href="https://github.com/Alipoodle/Dark-Matter-Update"><i class="mdi mdi-discord"></i><b> BetterDiscord Dark Matter Update</b></a><br> This is an updated version of the theme Dark Matter by <a href="https://github.com/cosmicsalad" class="other-people"><i class="mdi mdi-account"></i>cosmicsalad</a> for an extension of the Discord App called <a href="https://github.com/jiiks/betterdiscordapp" class="BD"><i class="mdi mdi-github-circle"></i> BetterDiscord</a>. This themes the new settings and a few other random things that were missed out in the main theme. There’s also an additional theme for adding Material Icons to the settings menu and a few other chat things like edit. I will continue to do updates for this as the main developer seems to have given up on it.
