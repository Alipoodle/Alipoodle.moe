      <h1 align="center" class="about-me"> 「About Me」</h1>
      <p>I'm a very Mysterious person. I don't like to show my face or my name to the world, and I go by the Alias as Alipoodle. I know Visual Basic and C# well, mainly as these are both .net languages, but I was taught VB in Year 10 and 11 in my Secondary School and then went on to self learn C# because of the similaries and C# is more widely used within programs. The only big thing I've made in for Visual Basic would be the Osu info!
        <br>I also have good knowledge within CSS, HTML and JS, however these are more for the the idea of Tweeking things. If there's a website, and there's something wrong with it I will generally change it to work nicely. One of the great examples of this is the BetterDiscord Dark Matter theme I've updated down there. Discord made a big change on the Settings page and I've continued to keep it looking nice!
        I've always had an Interest in computers, just because of at the time it was a very new thing that had potencial to do a lot.</p>
